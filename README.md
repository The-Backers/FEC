# The Backers
## Front End Capstone Project

A three person dev team created a mock product page for an e-retail site focusing on the front-end using advanced frameworks. React and Redux were the primary libraries used. This project was built in two weeks using guidelines from a mock buisness requirements document. The given data supplied to the team came from a blackbox API.

## Accessibility-and-Performance

Our application reaches __100% accessibility__ and has high performance levels.
A few metrics:

- The business requirements demanded a Time to First Paint of 0.8 seconds
	- We achieved this in 0.7 seconds
- The requested Time to Interactive was 2.5 seconds
	- Our application's came down to 2.2. seconds

# Components

Each team member was in charge of a component on the app. Anton Menchaca worked on the Product Overview, Nastassia Fulconis focused on the Related Items and the Outfits, and David Backer was in charge of the Reviews.

## Related Items Documentation
---
### Intro
This widget was built using the business requirements documented as well as the design mockup provided. All of the components were built from scratch using react and css styling.

---

### Related Items Breakdown
This section, following the business requirements, displays:

- a carousel of related products as given by the API. Each product card shows:
	- the product image
	- basic product information (product name, category, and price)
	- the product rating, as shown by the average number of stars received
- an outfits carousel, with each item displayed in product cards (described above). The outfits list:
	- enables a user to add the current product to their outfits list
	- enables a user to remove any product from their outfits list
	- is user specific. I implemented redux-persist in order to retain inputed data

## Reviews Documentation
---
### Intro
This component was built using the business requirements document as well as the design mockup provided. All of the components were built from scratch using react and css styling.

This section uses mostly react class components to store local states that affect a components content and styles. Eventually, these class components will be refactored out in favor of more redux containers and functional components utilizing react hooks.
